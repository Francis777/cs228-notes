Please note that the solutions are not intended for any form of distribution. All solutions are provided without the guarantee of being correct.

As a reference please follow the <span style="color:red">Collaboration Policy and Honor Code</span> quoted from the [course website](https://cs228.stanford.edu/):

> You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects. However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently without referring to any notes from the joint session. You should not copy, refer to, or look at the solutions from previous years’ homeworks in preparing your answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year’s solutions, either official or written up by another student. Anybody violating the honor code will be referred to the Office of Community Standards.
